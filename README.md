# ParallelTrains
Joint lab in which two trains travel along a railway at different speeds, containing parallel sections and single sections. The task is prevent collision.

NOTE: does not contain the simulator (unsure if it is allowed to share it)

NOTE2: This is the continuation of Lab1 (in which we used semaphores), here we use monitors but forgot to update comments
